# MNIST_Dataset

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

1. Applied MultiLayer Perceptron Netwrok Model using Tensolrflow and Keras on MNIST dataset with diffrent weight initializations, network parameters, layers and optimizers to calculate accuracy.
2. Applied different Convolution Neural Networks using Keras on MNIST dataset with different weight initializations, network parameters, layers and optimizers to calculate accuracy.
